## An autobot who adapts user repositories to work better with runnable.

Optimus is a RESTful transformer who helps our users by applying file system transformations to their repositories. He has two *prime* directives:

1. To test transformation and return debugging information (warnings, errors, and diffs)
2. To generate file transformation shell scripts (so they can be included in docker files)

*"Autobots, roll out!"
